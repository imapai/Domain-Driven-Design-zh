Although it is very satisfying working on a cutting-edge project and experimenting with interesting ideas and tools, for me it is a hollow experience if the software does not find productive use. In fact, the true test of success is how the software serves over a period of time. I have been able to follow the stories of some of my former projects over the years.</p> <p>I’ll discuss here five of those, each of which made a serious attempt at domain-driven design, though not systematically and not by that name, of course. All of these projects did deliver software: some managed to carry through and produce a model-driven design, while one slipped off that track. Some of the applications continued to grow and change for many years, while one stagnated and one died young.</p> <p>The PCB design software described in Chapter 1 was a smash hit among beta users in the field. Unfortunately, the start-up company that had initiated the project utterly failed in its marketing function and was eventually euthanized. The software is now used by a handful of PCB engineers who have old copies they kept from the beta program. Like any orphan software, it will continue to work until there is some fatal change to one of the programs with which it is integrated.</p> <p>The loan software whose story was told in Chapter 9 thrived and evolved along much the same track for three years after the breakthrough I wrote about. At that point, the project was spun off as an independent company. In the turmoil of this reorganization, the project manager who had led the project from the beginning was ejected, and some of the core developers left with him. The new team had a somewhat different design philosophy, not as fully committed to object modeling. But they retained a distinct domain layer with complex behavior and continued to value domain knowledge on the development team. Seven years after the spin-off, the software continues to be enhanced with new features. It is the leading application in its field and serves an increasing number of client institutions, as well as being the largest revenue stream for the company.</p> <p>Image
A Newly Planted Olive Grove</p> <p>Until the domain-driven approach is more widespread, the interesting software on many projects will be built in a short, highly productive interval. Eventually the project will transform into something more conventional that may not be able to fully exploit, much less enhance, the power of the deep models that were distilled earlier. I could wish for more, but truly those are successes that deliver sustained value to users over many years.</p> <p>On one project I paired with another developer to write a utility the customer needed to produce its core product. The features were fairly complicated and combined in intricate ways. I enjoyed the project work and we produced a supple design with an ABSTRACT CORE. When this software was handed off, that was the end of involvement for everyone who had initially developed it. Because it was such an abrupt transition, I expected that the design features which supported the combinable elements might be confusing and might get replaced by more typical case logic. This did not initially happen. When we handed off, the package included a thorough test suite and a distillation document. The new team members used that document to guide their explorations, and as they looked into things, they became excited by the possibilities the design presented. When I heard their comments a year later, I realized that the UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE had sparked across to the other team and stayed alive, continuing to evolve.</p> <p>Image
Seven Years Later</p> <p>Then, another year later, I heard a different story. The team had encountered new requirements that the developers didn’t see any way to accomplish within the inherited design. They had been forced to change the design almost beyond recognition. As I probed for more details, I could see that aspects of our model would have made solving those problems awkward. It is precisely during such moments when a breakthrough to a deeper model is often possible, especially when, as in this case, the developers had accumulated deep knowledge and experience in the domain. In fact, they had had a rush of new insights and ended up transforming the model and design based on those insights.</p> <p>They told me this story carefully, diplomatically, expecting, I suppose, that I would be disappointed by their discarding of so much of my work. I am not that sentimental about my designs. The success of a design is not necessarily marked by its stasis. Take a system people depend on, make it opaque, and it will live forever as untouchable legacy. A deep model allows clear vision that can yield new insight, while a supple design facilitates ongoing change. The model they came up with was deeper, better aligned with the real concerns of the users. Their design solved real problems. It is the nature of software to change, and this program has continued to evolve in the hands of the team that owns it.</p> <p>The shipping examples scattered through the book are loosely based on a project for a major international container-shipping company. Early on, the leadership of the project was committed to a domain-driven approach, but they never produced a development culture that could fully support it. Several teams with widely different levels of design skill and object experience set out to create modules, loosely coordinated by informal cooperation between team leaders and by a customer-focused architecture team. We did develop a reasonably deep model of the CORE DOMAIN, and there was a viable UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE.</p> <p>But the company culture fiercely resisted iterative development, and we waited far too long to push out a working internal release. Therefore, problems were exposed at a late stage, when they were more risky and expensive to fix. At some point, we discovered specific aspects of the model were causing performance problems in the database. A natural part of MODEL-DRIVEN DESIGN is the feedback from implementation problems to changes in the model, but by that time there was a perception that we were too far down the road to change the fundamental model. Instead, changes were made to the code to make it more efficient, and its connection to the model was weakened. The initial release also exposed scaling limitations in the technical infrastructure that threw a scare into management. Expertise was brought in to fix the infrastructure problems, and the project bounced back. But the loop was never closed between implementation and domain modeling.</p> <p>A few teams delivered fine software with complex capabilities and expressive models. Others delivered stiff software that reduced the model to data structures, though even they retained traces of the UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE. Perhaps a CONTEXT MAP would have helped us as much as anything, as the relationship between the output of the various teams was haphazard. Yet that CORE model carried in the UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE did help the teams ultimately to glue together a system.</p> <p>Although reduced in scope, the project replaced several legacy systems. The whole was held together by a shared set of concepts, though most of the design was not very supple. It has itself largely fossilized into legacy now, years later, but it still serves the global business 24 hours a day. Although the more successful teams’ influence gradually spread, time runs out eventually, even in the richest company. The culture of the project never really absorbed MODEL-DRIVEN DESIGN. New development today is on different platforms and is only indirectly influenced by the work we did—as the new developers CONFORM to their legacy.</p> <p>In some circles, ambitious goals like those the shipping company initially set have been discredited. Better, it seems, to make little applications we know how to deliver. Better to stick to the lowest common denominator of design to do simple things. This conservative approach has its place, and allows for neatly scoped, quick-response projects. But integrated, model-driven systems promise value that those patchworks can’t. There is a third way. Domain-driven design allows piecemeal growth of big systems with rich functionality, by building on a deep model and supple design.</p> <p>I’ll close this list with Evant, a company that develops inventory management software, where I played a secondary supporting role and contributed to an already strong design culture. Others have written about this project as a poster child of Extreme Programming, but what is not usually remarked upon is that the project was intensely domain-driven. Ever deeper models were distilled and expressed in ever more supple designs. This project thrived until the “dot com” crash of 2001. Then, starved for investment funds, the company contracted, software development went mostly dormant, and it seemed that the end was near. But in the summer of 2002, Evant was approached by one of the top ten retailers in the world. This potential client liked the product, but it needed design changes to allow the application to scale up for an enormous inventory planning operation. It was Evant’s last chance.</p> <p>Although reduced to four developers, the team had assets. They were skilled, with knowledge of the domain, and one member had expertise in scaling issues. They had a very effective development culture. And they had a code base with a supple design that facilitated change. That summer, those four developers made a heroic development effort resulting in the ability to handle billions of planning elements and hundreds of users. On the strength of those capabilities, Evant won the behemoth client and, soon after, was bought by another company that wanted to leverage their software and their proven ability to accommodate new demands.</p> <p>The domain-driven design culture (as well as the Extreme Programming culture) survived the transition and was revitalized. Today, the model and design continue to evolve, far richer and suppler two years later than when I made my contribution. And rather than being assimilated into the purchasing company, the members of the Evant team seem to be inspiring the company’s existing project teams to follow their lead. This story isn’t over yet.</p> <p>No project will ever employ every technique in this book. Even so, any project committed to domain-driven design will be recognizable in a few ways. The defining characteristic is a priority on understanding the target domain and incorporating that understanding into the software. Everything else flows from that premise. Team members are conscious of the use of language on the project and cultivate its refinement. They are hard to satisfy with the quality of the domain model, because they keep learning more about the domain. They see continuous refinement as an opportunity and an ill-fitting model as a risk. They take design skill seriously because it isn’t easy to develop production-quality software that clearly reflects the domain model. They stumble over obstacles, but they hold on to their principles as they pick themselves up and continue forward.</p> <p>LOOKING FORWARD
Weather, ecosystems, and biology used to be considered messy, “soft” fields in contrast to physics or chemistry. Recently, however, people have recognized that the appearance of “messiness” in fact presents a profound technical challenge to discover and understand the order in these very complex phenomena. The field called “complexity” is the vanguard of many sciences. Although purely technological tasks have generally seemed most interesting and challenging to talented software engineers, domain-driven design opens up a new area of challenge that is at least equal. Business software does not have to be a bolted-together mess. Wrestling a complex domain into a comprehensible software design is an exciting challenge for strong technical people.</p> <p>We are nowhere near the era of laypeople creating complex software that works. Armies of programmers with rudimentary skills can produce certain kinds of software, but not the kind that saves a company in its eleventh hour. What is needed is for tool builders to put their minds to the task of extending the power and productivity of talented software developers. What is needed are sharper ways of exploring domain models and expressing them in working software. I look forward to experimenting with new tools and technologies devised for this purpose.</p> <p>But though improved tools will be valuable, we mustn’t get distracted by them and lose sight of the core fact that creating good software is a learning and thinking activity. Modeling requires imagination and self-discipline. Tools that help us think or avoid distraction are good. Efforts to automate what must be the product of thought are naive and counterproductive.</p> <p>With the tools and technology we already have, we can build systems much more valuable than most projects do today. We can write software that is a pleasure to use and a pleasure to work on, software that doesn’t box us in as it grows but creates new opportunities and continues to add value for its owners.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><div class="edit-link"><a href="https://github.com/impapai/Domain-Driven-Design-zh/edit/master/docs/conclusion.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">帮助我们改善此页面！</a> <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></div> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated:</span> <span class="time">12/29/2019, 2:09:47 PM</span></div></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
