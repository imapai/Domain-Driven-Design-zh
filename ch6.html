The Life Cycle of a Domain Object</p></blockquote> <p>Every object has a life cycle. An object is born, it likely goes through various states, and it eventually dies—being either archived or deleted. Of course, many of these are simple, transient objects, created with an easy call to their constructor, used in some computation, and then abandoned to the garbage collector. There is no need to complicate such objects. But other objects have longer lives, not all of which are spent in active memory. They have complex interdependencies with other objects. They go through changes of state to which invariants apply. Managing these objects presents challenges that can easily derail an attempt at MODEL-DRIVEN DESIGN.</p> <p>Image
Figure 6.1. The life cycle of a domain object</p> <p>The challenges fall into two categories.</p> <ol><li><p>Maintaining integrity throughout the life cycle</p></li> <li><p>Preventing the model from getting swamped by the complexity of managing the life cycle</p></li></ol> <p>This chapter will address these issues through three patterns. First, AGGREGATES tighten up the model itself by defining clear ownership and boundaries, avoiding a chaotic, tangled web of objects. This pattern is crucial to maintaining integrity in all phases of the life cycle.</p> <p>Next, the focus turns to the beginning of the life cycle, using FACTORIES to create and reconstitute complex objects and AGGREGATES, keeping their internal structure encapsulated. Finally, REPOSITORIES address the middle and end of the life cycle, providing the means of finding and retrieving persistent objects while encapsulating the immense infrastructure involved.</p> <p>Although REPOSITORIES and FACTORIES do not themselves come from the domain, they have meaningful roles in the domain design. These constructs complete the MODEL-DRIVEN DESIGN by giving us accessible handles on the model objects.</p> <p>Modeling AGGREGATES and adding FACTORIES and REPOSITORIES to the design gives us the ability to manipulate the model objects systematically and in meaningful units throughout their life cycle. AGGREGATES mark off the scope within which invariants have to be maintained at every stage of the life cycle. FACTORIES and REPOSITORIES operate on AGGREGATES, encapsulating the complexity of specific life cycle transitions.</p> <p>AGGREGATES

Minimalist design of associations helps simplify traversal and limit the explosion of relationships somewhat, but most business domains are so interconnected that we still end up tracing long, deep paths through object references. In a way, this tangle reflects the realities of the world, which seldom obliges us with sharp boundaries. It is a problem in a software design.</p> <p>Say you were deleting a Person object from a database. Along with the person go a name, birth date, and job description. But what about the address? There could be other people at the same address. If you delete the address, those Person objects will have references to a deleted object. If you leave it, you accumulate junk addresses in the database. Automatic garbage collection could eliminate the junk addresses, but that technical fix, even if available in your database system, ignores a basic modeling issue.</p> <p>Even when considering an isolated transaction, the web of relationships in a typical object model gives no clear limit to the potential effect of a change. It is not practical to refresh every object in the system, just in case there is some dependency.</p> <p>The problem is acute in a system with concurrent access to the same objects by multiple clients. With many users consulting and updating different objects in the system, we have to prevent simultaneous changes to interdependent objects. Getting the scope wrong has serious consequences.</p> <p>It is difficult to guarantee the consistency of changes to objects in a model with complex associations. Invariants need to be maintained that apply to closely related groups of objects, not just discrete objects. Yet cautious locking schemes cause multiple users to interfere pointlessly with each other and make a system unusable.</p> <p>Put another way, how do we know where an object made up of other objects begins and ends? In any system with persistent storage of data, there must be a scope for a transaction that changes data, and a way of maintaining the consistency of the data (that is, maintaining its invariants). Databases allow various locking schemes, and tests can be programmed. But these ad hoc solutions divert attention away from the model, and soon you are back to hacking and hoping.</p> <p>In fact, finding a balanced solution to these kinds of problems calls for deeper understanding of the domain, this time extending to factors such as the frequency of change between the instances of certain classes. We need to find a model that leaves high-contention points looser and strict invariants tighter.</p> <p>Although this problem surfaces as technical difficulties in database transactions, it is rooted in the model—in its lack of defined boundaries. A solution driven from the model will make the model easier to understand and make the design easier to communicate. As the model is revised, it will guide our changes to the implementation.</p> <p>Schemes have been developed for defining ownership relationships in the model. The following simple but rigorous system, distilled from those concepts, includes a set of rules for implementing transactions that modify the objects and their owners.1</p> <p>First we need an abstraction for encapsulating references within the model. An AGGREGATE is a cluster of associated objects that we treat as a unit for the purpose of data changes. Each AGGREGATE has a root and a boundary. The boundary defines what is inside the AGGREGATE. The root is a single, specific ENTITY contained in the AGGREGATE. The root is the only member of the AGGREGATE that outside objects are allowed to hold references to, although objects within the boundary may hold references to each other. ENTITIES other than the root have local identity, but that identity needs to be distinguishable only within the AGGREGATE, because no outside object can ever see it out of the context of the root ENTITY.</p> <p>A model of a car might be used in software for an auto repair shop. The car is an ENTITY with global identity: we want to distinguish that car from all other cars in the world, even very similar ones. We can use the vehicle identification number for this, a unique identifier assigned to each new car. We might want to track the rotation history of the tires through the four wheel positions. We might want to know the mileage and tread wear of each tire. To know which tire is which, the tires must be identified ENTITIES also. But it is very unlikely that we care about the identity of those tires outside of the context of that particular car. If we replace the tires and send the old ones to a recycling plant, either our software will no longer track them at all, or they will become anonymous members of a heap of tires. No one will care about their rotation histories. More to the point, even while they are attached to the car, no one will try to query the system to find a particular tire and then see which car it is on. They will query the database to find a car and then ask it for a transient reference to the tires. Therefore, the car is the root ENTITY of the AGGREGATE whose boundary encloses the tires also. On the other hand, engine blocks have serial numbers engraved on them and are sometimes tracked independently of the car. In some applications, the engine might be the root of its own AGGREGATE.</p> <p>Image
Figure 6.2. Local versus global identity and object references</p> <p>Invariants, which are consistency rules that must be maintained whenever data changes, will involve relationships between members of the AGGREGATE. Any rule that spans AGGREGATES will not be expected to be up-to-date at all times. Through event processing, batch processing, or other update mechanisms, other dependencies can be resolved within some specified time. But the invariants applied within an AGGREGATE will be enforced with the completion of each transaction.</p> <p>Image
Figure 6.3. AGGREGATE invariants</p> <p>Now, to translate that conceptual AGGREGATE into the implementation, we need a set of rules to apply to all transactions.</p> <p>• The root ENTITY has global identity and is ultimately responsible for checking invariants.</p> <p>• Root ENTITIES have global identity. ENTITIES inside the boundary have local identity, unique only within the AGGREGATE.</p> <p>• Nothing outside the AGGREGATE boundary can hold a reference to anything inside, except to the root ENTITY. The root ENTITY can hand references to the internal ENTITIES to other objects, but those objects can use them only transiently, and they may not hold on to the reference. The root may hand a copy of a VALUE OBJECT to another object, and it doesn’t matter what happens to it, because it’s just a VALUE and no longer will have any association with the AGGREGATE.</p> <p>• As a corollary to the previous rule, only AGGREGATE roots can be obtained directly with database queries. All other objects must be found by traversal of associations.</p> <p>• Objects within the AGGREGATE can hold references to other AGGREGATE roots.</p> <p>• A delete operation must remove everything within the AGGREGATE boundary at once. (With garbage collection, this is easy. Because there are no outside references to anything but the root, delete the root and everything else will be collected.)</p> <p>• When a change to any object within the AGGREGATE boundary is committed, all invariants of the whole AGGREGATE must be satisfied.</p> <p>Cluster the ENTITIES and VALUE OBJECTS into AGGREGATES and define boundaries around each. Choose one ENTITY to be the root of each AGGREGATE, and control all access to the objects inside the boundary through the root. Allow external objects to hold references to the root only. Transient references to internal members can be passed out for use within a single operation only. Because the root controls access, it cannot be blindsided by changes to the internals. This arrangement makes it practical to enforce all invariants for objects in the AGGREGATE and for the AGGREGATE as a whole in any state change.</p> <p>It can be very helpful to have a technical framework that allows you to declare AGGREGATES and then automatically carries out the locking scheme and so forth. Without that assistance, the team must have the self-discipline to agree on the AGGREGATES and code consistently with them.</p> <p>Example: Purchase Order Integrity
Consider the complications possible in a simplified purchase order system.</p> <p>Image
Figure 6.4. A model for a purchase order system</p> <p>This diagram presents a pretty conventional view of a purchase order (PO), broken down into line items, with an invariant rule that the sum of the line items can’t exceed the limit for the PO as a whole. The existing implementation has three interrelated problems.</p> <ol><li><p>Invariant enforcement. When a new line item is added, the PO checks the total and marks itself invalid if an item pushes it over the limit. As we’ll see, this is not adequate protection.</p></li> <li><p>Change management. When the PO is deleted or archived, the line items are taken along, but the model gives no guidance on where to stop following the relationships. There is also confusion about the impact of changing the part price at different times.</p></li> <li><p>Sharing the database. Multiple users are creating contention problems in the database.</p></li></ol> <p>Multiple users will be entering and updating various POs concurrently, and we have to prevent them from messing up each other’s work. Let’s start with a very simple strategy, in which we lock any object a user begins to edit until that user commits the transaction. So, when George is editing line item 001, Amanda cannot access it. She can edit any other line item on any other PO (including other items in the PO George is working on).</p> <p>Image
Figure 6.5. The initial condition of the PO stored in the database</p> <p>Objects will be read from the database and instantiated in each user’s memory space. There they can be viewed and edited. Database locks will be requested only when an edit begins. So both George and Amanda can work concurrently, as long as they stay away from each other’s items. All is well . . . until both George and Amanda start working on separate line items in the same PO.</p> <p>Image
Figure 6.6. Simultaneous edits in distinct transactions</p> <p>Everything looks fine to both users and to their software because they ignore changes to other parts of the database that happen during the transaction, and neither locked line item is involved in the other user’s change.</p> <p>Image
Figure 6.7. The resulting PO violates the approval limit (broken invariant).</p> <p>After both users have saved their changes, a PO is stored in the database that violates the invariant of the domain model. An important business rule has been broken. And nobody even knows.</p> <p>Clearly, locking a single line item isn’t an adequate safeguard. If instead we had locked an entire PO at a time, the problem would have been prevented.</p> <p>Image
Figure 6.8. Locking the entire PO allows the invariant to be enforced.</p> <p>The program will not allow this transaction to be saved until Amanda has resolved the problem, perhaps by raising the limit or by eliminating a guitar. This mechanism prevents the problem, and it may be a fine solution if work is mostly spread widely across many POs. But if multiple people typically work simultaneously on different line items of a large PO, then this locking will get cumbersome.</p> <p>Even assuming many small POs, there are other ways to violate the assertion. Consider that “part.” If someone changed the price of a trombone while Amanda was adding to her order, wouldn’t that violate the invariant too?</p> <p>Let’s try locking the part in addition to the entire PO. Here’s what happens when George, Amanda, and Sam are working on different POs:</p> <p>Image
Figure 6.9. Over-cautious locking is interfering with people’s work.</p> <p>The inconvenience is mounting, because there is a lot of contention for the instruments (the “parts”). And then:</p> <p>Image
Figure 6.10. Deadlock</p> <p>Those three will be waiting a while.</p> <p>At this point we can begin to improve the model by incorporating the following knowledge of the business:</p> <ol><li><p>Parts are used in many POs (high contention).</p></li> <li><p>There are fewer changes to parts than there are to POs.</p></li> <li><p>Changes to part prices do not necessarily propagate to existing POs. It depends on the time of a price change relative to the status of the PO.</p></li></ol> <p>Point 3 is particularly obvious when we consider archived POs that have already been delivered. They should, of course, show the prices as of the time they were filled, rather than current prices.</p> <p>Image
Figure 6.11. Price is copied into Line Item. AGGREGATE invariant can now be enforced.</p> <p>An implementation consistent with this model would guarantee the invariant relating PO and its items, while changes to the price of a part would not have to immediately affect the items that reference it. Broader consistency rules could be addressed in other ways. For example, the system could present a queue of items with outdated prices to the users each day, so they could update or exempt each one. But this is not an invariant that must be enforced at all times. By making the dependency of line items on parts looser, we avoid contention and reflect the realities of the business better. At the same time, tightening the relationship of the PO and its line items guarantees that an important business rule will be followed.</p> <p>The AGGREGATE imposes an ownership of the PO and its items that is consistent with business practice. The creation and deletion of a PO and items are naturally tied together, while the creation and deletion of parts is independent.</p> <p>Image Image Image
AGGREGATES mark off the scope within which invariants have to be maintained at every stage of the life cycle. The following patterns, FACTORIES and REPOSITORIES, operate on AGGREGATES, encapsulating the complexity of specific life cycle transitions. . . .</p> <p>FACTORIES
Image
When creation of an object, or an entire AGGREGATE, becomes complicated or reveals too much of the internal structure, FACTORIES provide encapsulation.</p> <p>Image Image Image
Much of the power of objects rests in the intricate configuration of their internals and their associations. An object should be distilled until nothing remains that does not relate to its meaning or support its role in interactions. This mid-life cycle responsibility is plenty. Problems arise from overloading a complex object with responsibility for its own creation.</p> <p>A car engine is an intricate piece of machinery, with dozens of parts collaborating to perform the engine’s responsibility: to turn a shaft. One could imagine trying to design an engine block that could grab on to a set of pistons and insert them into its cylinders, spark plugs that would find their sockets and screw themselves in. But it seems unlikely that such a complicated machine would be as reliable or as efficient as our typical engines are. Instead, we accept that something else will assemble the pieces. Perhaps it will be a human mechanic or perhaps it will be an industrial robot. Both the robot and the human are actually more complex than the engine they assemble. The job of assembling parts is completely unrelated to the job of spinning a shaft. The assemblers function only during the creation of the car—you don’t need a robot or a mechanic with you when you’re driving. Because cars are never assembled and driven at the same time, there is no value in combining both of these functions into the same mechanism. Likewise, assembling a complex compound object is a job that is best separated from whatever job that object will have to do when it is finished.</p> <p>But shifting responsibility to the other interested party, the client object in the application, leads to even worse problems. The client knows what job needs to be done and relies on the domain objects to carry out the necessary computations. If the client is expected to assemble the domain objects it needs, it must know something about the internal structure of the object. In order to enforce all the invariants that apply to the relationship of parts in the domain object, the client must know some of the object’s rules. Even calling constructors couples the client to the concrete classes of the objects it is building. No change to the implementation of the domain objects can be made without changing the client, making refactoring harder.</p> <p>A client taking on object creation becomes unnecessarily complicated and blurs its responsibility. It breaches the encapsulation of the domain objects and the AGGREGATES being created. Even worse, if the client is part of the application layer, then responsibilities have leaked out of the domain layer altogether. This tight coupling of the application to the specifics of the implementation strips away most of the benefits of abstraction in the domain layer and makes continuing changes ever more expensive.</p> <p>Creation of an object can be a major operation in itself, but complex assembly operations do not fit the responsibility of the created objects. Combining such responsibilities can produce ungainly designs that are hard to understand. Making the client direct construction muddies the design of the client, breaches encapsulation of the assembled object or AGGREGATE, and overly couples the client to the implementation of the created object.</p> <p>Complex object creation is a responsibility of the domain layer, yet that task does not belong to the objects that express the model. There are some cases in which an object creation and assembly corresponds to a milestone significant in the domain, such as “open a bank account.” But object creation and assembly usually have no meaning in the domain; they are a necessity of the implementation. To solve this problem, we have to add constructs to the domain design that are not ENTITIES, VALUE OBJECTS, or SERVICES. This is a departure from the previous chapter, and it is important to make the point clear: We are adding elements to the design that do not correspond to anything in the model, but they are nonetheless part of the domain layer’s responsibility.</p> <p>Every object-oriented language provides a mechanism for creating objects (constructors in Java and C++, instance creation class methods in Smalltalk, for example), but there is a need for more abstract construction mechanisms that are decoupled from the other objects. A program element whose responsibility is the creation of other objects is called a FACTORY.</p> <p>Image
Figure 6.12. Basic interactions with a FACTORY</p> <p>Just as the interface of an object should encapsulate its implementation, thus allowing a client to use the object’s behavior without knowing how it works, a FACTORY encapsulates the knowledge needed to create a complex object or AGGREGATE. It provides an interface that reflects the goals of the client and an abstract view of the created object.</p> <p>Therefore:</p> <p>Shift the responsibility for creating instances of complex objects and AGGREGATES to a separate object, which may itself have no responsibility in the domain model but is still part of the domain design. Provide an interface that encapsulates all complex assembly and that does not require the client to reference the concrete classes of the objects being instantiated. Create entire AGGREGATES as a piece, enforcing their invariants.</p> <p>Image Image Image
There are many ways to design FACTORIES. Several special-purpose creation patterns—FACTORY METHOD, ABSTRACT FACTORY, and BUILDER—were thoroughly treated in Gamma et al. 1995. That book mostly explored patterns for the most difficult object construction problems. The point here is not to delve deeply into designing FACTORIES, but rather to show the place of FACTORIES as important components of a domain design. Proper use of FACTORIES can help keep a MODEL-DRIVEN DESIGN on track.</p> <p>The two basic requirements for any good FACTORY are</p> <ol><li><p>Each creation method is atomic and enforces all invariants of the created object or AGGREGATE. A FACTORY should only be able to produce an object in a consistent state. For an ENTITY, this means the creation of the entire AGGREGATE, with all invariants satisfied, but probably with optional elements still to be added. For an immutable VALUE OBJECT, this means that all attributes are initialized to their correct final state. If the interface makes it possible to request an object that can’t be created correctly, then an exception should be raised or some other mechanism should be invoked that will ensure that no improper return value is possible.</p></li> <li><p>The FACTORY should be abstracted to the type desired, rather than the concrete class(es) created. The sophisticated FACTORY patterns in Gamma et al. 1995 help with this.</p></li></ol> <p>Choosing FACTORIES and Their Sites
Generally speaking, you create a factory to build something whose details you want to hide, and you place the FACTORY where you want the control to be. These decisions usually revolve around AGGREGATES.</p> <p>For example, if you needed to add elements inside a preexisting AGGREGATE, you might create a FACTORY METHOD on the root of the AGGREGATE. This hides the implementation of the interior of the AGGREGATE from any external client, while giving the root responsibility for ensuring the integrity of the AGGREGATE as elements are added, as shown in Figure 6.13 on the next page.</p> <p>Image
Figure 6.13. A FACTORY METHOD encapsulates expansion of an AGGREGATE.</p> <p>Another example would be to place a FACTORY METHOD on an object that is closely involved in spawning another object, although it doesn’t own the product once it is created. When the data and possibly the rules of one object are very dominant in the creation of an object, this saves pulling information out of the spawner to be used elsewhere to create the object. It also communicates the special relationship between the spawner and the product.</p> <p>In Figure 6.14, the Trade Order is not part of the same AGGREGATE as the Brokerage Account because, for a start, it will go on to interact with the trade execution application, where the Brokerage Account would only be in the way. Even so, it seems natural to give the Brokerage Account control over the creation of Trade Orders. The Brokerage Account contains information that will be embedded in the Trade Order (starting with its own identity), and it contains rules that govern what trades are allowed. We might also benefit from hiding the implementation of Trade Order. For example, it might be refactored into a hierarchy, with separate subclasses for Buy Order and Sell Order. The FACTORY keeps the client from being coupled to the concrete classes.</p> <p>Image
Figure 6.14. A FACTORY METHOD spawns an ENTITY that is not part of the same AGGREGATE.</p> <p>A FACTORY is very tightly coupled to its product, so a FACTORY should be attached only to an object that has a close natural relationship with the product. When there is something we want to hide—either the concrete implementation or the sheer complexity of construction—yet there doesn’t seem to be a natural host, we must create a dedicated FACTORY object or SERVICE. A standalone FACTORY usually produces an entire AGGREGATE, handing out a reference to the root, and ensuring that the product AGGREGATE’S invariants are enforced. If an object interior to an AGGREGATE needs a FACTORY, and the AGGREGATE root is not a reasonable home for it, then go ahead and make a standalone FACTORY. But respect the rules limiting access within an AGGREGATE, and make sure there are only transient references to the product from outside the AGGREGATE.</p> <p>Image
Figure 6.15. A standalone FACTORY builds AGGREGATE.</p> <p>When a Constructor Is All You Need
I’ve seen far too much code in which all instances are created by directly calling class constructors, or whatever the primitive level of instance creation is for the programming language. The introduction of FACTORIES has great advantages, and is generally underused. Yet there are times when the directness of a constructor makes it the best choice. FACTORIES can actually obscure simple objects that don’t use polymorphism.</p> <p>The trade-offs favor a bare, public constructor in the following circumstances.</p> <p>• The class is the type. It is not part of any interesting hierarchy, and it isn’t used polymorphically by implementing an interface.</p> <p>• The client cares about the implementation, perhaps as a way of choosing a STRATEGY.</p> <p>• All of the attributes of the object are available to the client, so that no object creation gets nested inside the constructor exposed to the client.</p> <p>• The construction is not complicated.</p> <p>• A public constructor must follow the same rules as a FACTORY: It must be an atomic operation that satisfies all invariants of the created object.</p> <p>Avoid calling constructors within constructors of other classes. Constructors should be dead simple. Complex assemblies, especially of AGGREGATES, call for FACTORIES. The threshold for choosing to use a little FACTORY METHOD isn’t high.</p> <p>The Java class library offers interesting examples. All collections implement interfaces that decouple the client from the concrete implementation. Yet they are all created by direct calls to constructors. A FACTORY could have encapsulated the collection hierarchy. The FACTORY’s methods could have allowed a client to ask for the features it needed, with the FACTORY selecting the appropriate class to instantiate. Code that created collections would be more expressive, and new collection classes could be installed without breaking every Java program.</p> <p>But there is a case in favor of the concrete constructors. First, the choice of implementation can be performance sensitive for many applications, so an application might want control. (Even so, a really smart FACTORY could accommodate such factors.) Anyway, there aren’t very many collection classes, so it isn’t that complicated to choose.</p> <p>The abstract collection types preserve some value in spite of the lack of a FACTORY because of their usage patterns. Collections are very often created in one place and used in another. This means that the client that ultimately uses the collection—adding, removing, and retrieving its contents—can still talk to the interface and be decoupled from the implementation. The selection of a collection class typically falls to the object that owns the collection, or to the owning object’s FACTORY.</p> <p>Designing the Interface
When designing the method signature of a FACTORY, whether standalone or FACTORY METHOD, keep in mind these two points.</p> <p>• Each operation must be atomic. You have to pass in everything needed to create a complete product in a single interaction with the FACTORY. You also have to decide what will happen if creation fails, in the event that some invariant isn’t satisfied. You could throw an exception or just return a null. To be consistent, consider adopting a coding standard for failures in FACTORIES.</p> <p>• The FACTORY will be coupled to its arguments. If you are not careful in your selection of input parameters, you can create a rat’s nest of dependencies. The degree of coupling will depend on what you do with the argument. If it is simply plugged into the product, you’ve created a modest dependency. If you are picking parts out of the argument to use in the construction, the coupling gets tighter.</p> <p>The safest parameters are those from a lower design layer. Even within a layer, there tend to be natural strata with more basic objects that are used by higher level objects. (Such layering will be discussed in different ways in Chapter 10, “Supple Design,” and again in Chapter 16, “Large-Scale Structure.”)</p> <p>Another good choice of parameter is an object that is closely related to the product in the model, so that no new dependency is being added. In the earlier example of a Purchase Order Item, the FACTORY METHOD takes a Catalog Part as an argument, which is an essential association for the Item. This adds a direct dependency between the Purchase Order class and the Part. But these three objects form a close conceptual group. The Purchase Order’s AGGREGATE already referenced the Part, anyway. So giving control to the AGGREGATE root and encapsulating the AGGREGATE’S internal structure is a good trade-off.</p> <p>Use the abstract type of the arguments, not their concrete classes. The FACTORY is coupled to the concrete class of the products; it does not need to be coupled to concrete parameters also.</p> <p>Where Does Invariant Logic Go?
A FACTORY is responsible for ensuring that all invariants are met for the object or AGGREGATE it creates; yet you should always think twice before removing the rules applying to an object outside that object. The FACTORY can delegate invariant checking to the product, and this is often best.</p> <p>But FACTORIES have a special relationship with their products. They already know their product’s internal structure, and their entire reason for being involves the implementation of their product. Under some circumstances, there are advantages to placing invariant logic in the FACTORY and reducing clutter in the product. This is especially appealing with AGGREGATE rules (which span many objects). It is especially unappealing with FACTORY METHODS attached to other domain objects.</p> <p>Although in principle invariants apply at the end of every operation, often the transformations allowed to the object can never bring them into play. There might be a rule that applies to the assignment of the identity attributes of an ENTITY. But after creation that identity is immutable. VALUE OBJECTS are completely immutable. An object doesn’t need to carry around logic that will never be applied in its active lifetime. In such cases, the FACTORY is a logical place to put invariants, keeping the product simpler.</p> <p>ENTITY FACTORIES Versus VALUE OBJECT FACTORIES
ENTITY FACTORIES differ from VALUE OBJECT FACTORIES in two ways. VALUE OBJECTS are immutable; the product comes out complete in its final form. So the FACTORY operations have to allow for a full description of the product. ENTITY FACTORIES tend to take just the essential attributes required to make a valid AGGREGATE. Details can be added later if they are not required by an invariant.</p> <p>Then there are the issues involved in assigning identity to an ENTITY—irrelevant to a VALUE OBJECT. As pointed out in Chapter 5, an identifier can either be assigned automatically by the program or supplied from the outside, typically by the user. If a customer’s identity is to be tracked by the telephone number, then that telephone number must obviously be passed in as an argument to the FACTORY. When the program is assigning an identifier, the FACTORY is a good place to control it. Although the actual generation of a unique tracking ID is typically done by a database “sequence” or other infrastructure mechanism, the FACTORY knows what to ask for and where to put it.</p> <p>Reconstituting Stored Objects
Up to this point, the FACTORY has played its part in the very beginning of an object’s life cycle. At some point, most objects get stored in databases or transmitted through a network, and few current database technologies retain the object character of their contents. Most transmission methods flatten an object into an even more limited presentation. Therefore, retrieval requires a potentially complex process of reassembling the parts into a live object.</p> <p>A FACTORY used for reconstitution is very similar to one used for creation, with two major differences.</p> <ol><li><p>An ENTITY FACTORY used for reconstitution does not assign a new tracking ID. To do so would lose the continuity with the object’s previous incarnation. So identifying attributes must be part of the input parameters in a FACTORY reconstituting a stored object.</p></li> <li><p>A FACTORY reconstituting an object will handle violation of an invariant differently. During creation of a new object, a FACTORY should simply balk when an invariant isn’t met, but a more flexible response may be necessary in reconstitution. If an object already exists somewhere in the system (such as in the database), this fact cannot be ignored. Yet we also can’t ignore the rule violation. There has to be some strategy for repairing such inconsistencies, which can make reconstitution more challenging than the creation of new objects.</p></li></ol> <p>Figures 6.16 and 6.17 (on the next page) show two kinds of reconstitution. Object-mapping technologies may provide some or all of these services in the case of database reconstitution, which is convenient. Whenever there is exposed complexity in reconstituting an object from another medium, the FACTORY is a good option.</p> <p>Image
Figure 6.16. Reconstituting an ENTITY retrieved from a relational database</p> <p>Image
Figure 6.17. Reconstituting an ENTITY transmitted as XML</p> <p>To sum up, the access points for creation of instances must be identified, and their scope must be defined explicitly. They may simply be constructors, but often there is a need for a more abstract or elaborate instance creation mechanism. This need introduces new constructs into the design: FACTORIES. FACTORIES usually do not express any part of the model, yet they are a part of the domain design that helps keep the model-expressing objects sharp.</p> <p>A FACTORY encapsulates the life cycle transitions of creation and reconstitution. Another transition that exposes technical complexity that can swamp the domain design is the transition to and from storage. This transition is the responsibility of another domain design construct, the REPOSITORY.</p> <p>REPOSITORIES
Image
Associations allow us to find an object based on its relationship to another. But we must have a starting point for a traversal to an ENTITY or VALUE in the middle of its life cycle.</p> <p>Image Image Image
To do anything with an object, you have to hold a reference to it. How do you get that reference? One way is to create the object, as the creation operation will return a reference to the new object. A second way is to traverse an association. You start with an object you already know and ask it for an associated object. Any object-oriented program is going to do a lot of this, and these links give object models much of their expressive power. But you have to get that first object.</p> <p>I actually encountered a project once in which the team was attempting, in an enthusiastic embrace of MODEL-DRIVEN DESIGN, to do all object access by creation or traversal! Their objects resided in an object database, and they reasoned that existing conceptual relationships would provide all necessary associations. They needed only to analyze them enough, making their entire domain model cohesive. This self-imposed limitation forced them to create just the kind of endless tangle that we have been trying to avert over the last few chapters, with careful implementation of ENTITIES and application of AGGREGATES. The team members didn’t stick with this strategy long, but they never replaced it with another coherent approach. They cobbled together ad hoc solutions and became less ambitious.</p> <p>Few would even think of this approach, much less be tempted by it, because they store most of their objects in relational databases. This storage technology makes it natural to use the third way of getting a reference: Execute a query to find the object in a database based on its attributes, or find the constituents of an object and then reconstitute it.</p> <p>A database search is globally accessible and makes it possible to go directly to any object. There is no need for all objects to be interconnected, which allows us to keep the web of objects manageable. Whether to provide a traversal or depend on a search becomes a design decision, trading off the decoupling of the search against the cohesiveness of the association. Should the Customer object hold a collection of all the Orders placed? Or should the Orders be found in the database, with a search on the Customer ID field? The right combination of search and association makes the design comprehensible.</p> <p>Unfortunately, developers don’t usually get to think much about such design subtleties, because they are swimming in the sea of mechanisms needed to pull off the trick of storing an object and bringing it back—and eventually removing it from storage.</p> <p>Now from a technical point of view, retrieval of a stored object is really a subset of creation, because the data from the database is used to assemble new objects. Indeed, the code that usually has to be written makes it hard to forget this reality. But conceptually, this is the middle of the life cycle of an ENTITY. A Customer object does not represent a new customer just because we stored it in a database and retrieved it. To keep this distinction in mind, I refer to the creation of an instance from stored data as reconstitution.</p> <p>The goal of domain-driven design is to create better software by focusing on a model of the domain rather than the technology. By the time a developer has constructed an SQL query, passed it to a query service in the infrastructure layer, obtained a result set of table rows, pulled the necessary information out, and passed it to a constructor or FACTORY, the model focus is gone. It becomes natural to think of the objects as containers for the data that the queries provide, and the whole design shifts toward a data-processing style. The details of the technology vary, but the problem remains that the client is dealing with technology, rather than model concepts. Infrastructure such as METADATA MAPPING LAYERS (Fowler 2003) help a great deal, by making easier the conversion of the query result into objects, but the developer is still thinking about technical mechanisms, not the domain. Worse, as client code uses the database directly, developers are tempted to bypass model features such as AGGREGATES, or even object encapsulation, instead directly taking and manipulating the data they need. More and more domain rules become embedded in query code or simply lost. Object databases do eliminate the conversion problem, but search mechanisms are usually still mechanistic, and developers are still tempted to grab whatever objects they want.</p> <p>A client needs a practical means of acquiring references to preexisting domain objects. If the infrastructure makes it easy to do so, the developers of the client may add more traversable associations, muddling the model. On the other hand, they may use queries to pull the exact data they need from the database, or to pull a few specific objects rather than navigating from AGGREGATE roots. Domain logic moves into queries and client code, and the ENTITIES and VALUE OBJECTS become mere data containers. The sheer technical complexity of applying most database access infrastructure quickly swamps the client code, which leads developers to dumb down the domain layer, which makes the model irrelevant.</p> <p>Drawing on the design principles discussed so far, we can reduce the scope of the object access problem somewhat, assuming that we find a method of access that keeps the model focus sharp enough to employ those principles. For starters, we need not concern ourselves with transient objects. Transients (typically VALUE OBJECTS) live brief lives, used in the client operation that created them and then discarded. We also need no query access for persistent objects that are more convenient to find by traversal. For example, the address of a person could be requested from the Person object. And most important, any object internal to an AGGREGATE is prohibited from access except by traversal from the root.</p> <p>Persistent VALUE OBJECTS are usually found by traversal from some ENTITY that acts as the root of the AGGREGATE that encapsulates them. In fact, a global search access to a VALUE is often meaningless, because finding a VALUE by its properties would be equivalent to creating a new instance with those properties. There are exceptions, though. For example, when I am planning travel online, I sometimes save a few prospective itineraries and return later to select one to book. Those itineraries are VALUES (if there were two made up of the same flights, I would not care which was which), but they have been associated with my user name and retrieved for me intact. Another case would be an “enumeration,” when a type has a strictly limited, predetermined set of possible values. Global access to VALUE OBJECTS is much less common than for ENTITIES, though, and if you find you need to search the database for a preexisting VALUE, it is worth considering the possibility that you’ve really got an ENTITY whose identity you haven’t recognized.</p> <p>From this discussion, it is clear that most objects should not be accessed by a global search. It would be nice for the design to communicate those that do.</p> <p>Now the problem can be restated more precisely.</p> <p>A subset of persistent objects must be globally accessible through a search based on object attributes. Such access is needed for the roots of AGGREGATES that are not convenient to reach by traversal. They are usually ENTITIES, sometimes VALUE OBJECTS with complex internal structure, and sometimes enumerated VALUES. Providing access to other objects muddies important distinctions. Free database queries can actually breach the encapsulation of domain objects and AGGREGATES. Exposure of technical infrastructure and database access mechanisms complicates the client and obscures the MODEL-DRIVEN DESIGN.</p> <p>There is a raft of techniques for dealing with the technical challenges of database access. Examples include encapsulating SQL into QUERY OBJECTS or translating between objects and tables with METADATA MAPPING LAYERS (Fowler 2003). FACTORIES can help reconstitute stored objects (as discussed later in this chapter). These and many other techniques help keep a lid on complexity.</p> <p>But even so, take note of what has been lost. We are no longer thinking about concepts in our domain model. Our code will not be communicating about the business; it will be manipulating the technology of data retrieval. The REPOSITORY pattern is a simple conceptual framework to encapsulate those solutions and bring back our model focus.</p> <p>A REPOSITORY represents all objects of a certain type as a conceptual set (usually emulated). It acts like a collection, except with more elaborate querying capability. Objects of the appropriate type are added and removed, and the machinery behind the REPOSITORY inserts them or deletes them from the database. This definition gathers a cohesive set of responsibilities for providing access to the roots of AGGREGATES from early life cycle through the end.</p> <p>Clients request objects from the REPOSITORY using query methods that select objects based on criteria specified by the client, typically the value of certain attributes. The REPOSITORY retrieves the requested object, encapsulating the machinery of database queries and metadata mapping. REPOSITORIES can implement a variety of queries that select objects based on whatever criteria the client requires. They can also return summary information, such as a count of how many instances meet some criteria. They can even return summary calculations, such as the total across all matching objects of some numerical attribute.</p> <p>Image
Figure 6.18. A REPOSITORY doing a search for a client</p> <p>A REPOSITORY lifts a huge burden from the client, which can now talk to a simple, intention-revealing interface, and ask for what it needs in terms of the model. To support all this requires a lot of complex technical infrastructure, but the interface is simple and conceptually connected to the domain model.</p> <p>Therefore:</p> <p>For each type of object that needs global access, create an object that can provide the illusion of an in-memory collection of all objects of that type. Set up access through a well-known global interface. Provide methods to add and remove objects, which will encapsulate the actual insertion or removal of data in the data store. Provide methods that select objects based on some criteria and return fully instantiated objects or collections of objects whose attribute values meet the criteria, thereby encapsulating the actual storage and query technology. Provide REPOSITORIES only for AGGREGATE roots that actually need direct access. Keep the client focused on the model, delegating all object storage and access to the REPOSITORIES.</p> <p>Image Image Image
REPOSITORIES have many advantages, including the following:</p> <p>• They present clients with a simple model for obtaining persistent objects and managing their life cycle.</p> <p>• They decouple application and domain design from persistence technology, multiple database strategies, or even multiple data sources.</p> <p>• They communicate design decisions about object access.</p> <p>• They allow easy substitution of a dummy implementation, for use in testing (typically using an in-memory collection).</p> <p>Querying a REPOSITORY
All repositories provide methods that allow a client to request objects matching some criteria, but there is a range of options of how to design this interface.</p> <p>The easiest REPOSITORY to build has hard-coded queries with specific parameters. These queries can be various: retrieving an ENTITY by its identity (provided by almost all REPOSITORIES); requesting a collection of objects with a particular attribute value or a complex combination of parameters; selecting objects based on value ranges (such as date ranges); and even performing some calculations that fall within the general responsibility of a REPOSITORY (especially drawing on operations supported by the underlying database).</p> <p>Although most queries return an object or a collection of objects, it also fits within the concept to return some types of summary calculations, such as an object count, or a sum of a numerical attribute that was intended by the model to be tallied.</p> <p>Image
Figure 6.19. Hard-coded queries in a simple REPOSITORY</p> <p>Hard-coded queries can be built on top of any infrastructure and without a lot of investment, because they do just what some client would have had to do anyway.</p> <p>On projects with a lot of querying, a REPOSITORY framework can be built that allows more flexible queries. This calls for a staff familiar with the necessary technology and is greatly aided by a supportive infrastructure.</p> <p>One particularly apt approach to generalizing REPOSITORIES through a framework is to use SPECIFICATION-based queries. A SPECIFICATION allows a client to describe (that is, specify) what it wants without concern for how it will be obtained. In the process, an object that can actually carry out the selection is created. This pattern will be discussed in depth in Chapter 9.</p> <p>Image
Figure 6.20. A flexible, declarative SPECIFICATION of search criteria in a sophisticated REPOSITORY</p> <p>The SPECIFICATION-based query is elegant and flexible. Depending on the infrastructure available, it may be a modest framework or it may be prohibitively difficult. Rob Mee and Edward Hieatt discuss more of the technical issues involved in designing such REPOSITORIES in Fowler 2003.</p> <p>Even a REPOSITORY design with flexible queries should allow for the addition of specialized hard-coded queries. They might be convenience methods that encapsulate an often-used query or a query that doesn’t return the objects themselves, such as a mathematical summary of selected objects. Frameworks that don’t allow for such contingencies tend to distort the domain design or get bypassed by developers.</p> <p>Client Code Ignores REPOSITORY Implementation; Developers Do Not
Encapsulation of the persistence technology allows the client to be very simple, completely decoupled from the implementation of the REPOSITORY. But as is often the case with encapsulation, the developer must understand what is happening under the hood. The performance implications can be extreme when REPOSITORIES are used in different ways or work in different ways.</p> <p>Kyle Brown told me the story of getting called in on a manufacturing application based on WebSphere that was being rolled out to production. The system was mysteriously running out of memory after a few hours of use. Kyle browsed through the code and found the reason: At one point, they were summarizing some information about every item in the plant. The developers had done this using a query called “all objects,” which instantiated each of the objects and then selected the bits they needed. This code had the effect of bringing the entire database into memory at once! The problem hadn’t shown up in testing because of the small amount of test data.</p> <p>This is an obvious no-no, but much more subtle oversights can present equally serious problems. Developers need to understand the implications of using encapsulated behavior. That does not have to mean detailed familiarity with the implementation. Well-designed components can be characterized. (This is one of the main points of Chapter 10, “Supple Design.”)</p> <p>As was discussed in Chapter 5, the underlying technology may constrain your modeling choices. For example, a relational database can place a practical limit on deep compositional object structures. In just the same way, there must be feedback to developers in both directions between the use of the REPOSITORY and the implementation of its queries.</p> <p>Implementing a REPOSITORY
Implementation will vary greatly, depending on the technology being used for persistence and the infrastructure you have. The ideal is to hide all the inner workings from the client (although not from the developer of the client), so that client code will be the same whether the data is stored in an object database, stored in a relational database, or simply held in memory. The REPOSITORY will delegate to the appropriate infrastructure services to get the job done. Encapsulating the mechanisms of storage, retrieval, and query is the most basic feature of a REPOSITORY implementation.</p> <p>Image
Figure 6.21. The REPOSITORY encapsulates the underlying data store.</p> <p>The REPOSITORY concept is adaptable to many situations. The possibilities of implementation are so diverse that I can only list some concerns to keep in mind.</p> <p>• Abstract the type. A REPOSITORY “contains” all instances of a specific type, but this does not mean that you need one REPOSITORY for each class. The type could be an abstract superclass of a hierarchy (for example, a TradeOrder could be a BuyOrder or a Sell-Order). The type could be an interface whose implementers are not even hierarchically related. Or it could be a specific concrete class. Keep in mind that you may well face constraints imposed by the lack of such polymorphism in your database technology.</p> <p>• Take advantage of the decoupling from the client. You have more freedom to change the implementation of a REPOSITORY than you would if the client were calling the mechanisms directly. You can take advantage of this to optimize for performance, by varying the query technique or by caching objects in memory, freely switching persistence strategies at any time. You can facilitate testing of the client code and the domain objects by providing an easily manipulated, dummy in-memory strategy.</p> <p>• Leave transaction control to the client. Although the REPOSITORY will insert into and delete from the database, it will ordinarily not commit anything. It is tempting to commit after saving, for example, but the client presumably has the context to correctly initiate and commit units of work. Transaction management will be simpler if the REPOSITORY keeps its hands off.</p> <p>Typically teams add a framework to the infrastructure layer to support the implementation of REPOSITORIES. In addition to the collaboration with the lower level infrastructure components, the REPOSITORY superclass might implement some basic queries, especially when a flexible query is being implemented. Unfortunately, with a type system such as Java’s, this approach would force you to type returned objects as “Object,” leaving the client to cast them to the REPOSITORY’S contained type. But of course, this will have to be done with queries that return collections anyway in Java.</p> <p>Some additional guidance on implementing REPOSITORIES and some of their supporting technical patterns such as QUERY OBJECT can be found in Fowler (2003).</p> <p>Working Within Your Frameworks
Before implementing something like a REPOSITORY, you need to think carefully about the infrastructure you are committed to, especially any architectural frameworks. You may find that the framework provides services you can use to easily create a REPOSITORY, or you may find that the framework fights you all the way. You may discover that the architectural framework has already defined an equivalent pattern of getting persistent objects. Or you may discover that it has defined a pattern that is not like a REPOSITORY at all.</p> <p>For example, your project might be committed to J2EE. Looking for conceptual affinities between the framework and the patterns of MODEL-DRIVEN DESIGN (and keeping in mind that an entity bean is not the same thing as an ENTITY), you may have chosen to use entity beans to correspond to AGGREGATE roots. The construct within the architectural framework of J2EE that is responsible for providing access to these objects is the “EJB Home.” Trying to dress up the EJB Home to look like a REPOSITORY could lead to other problems.</p> <p>In general, don’t fight your frameworks. Seek ways to keep the fundamentals of domain-driven design and let go of the specifics when the framework is antagonistic. Look for affinities between the concepts of domain-driven design and the concepts in the framework. This is assuming that you have no choice but to use the framework. Many J2EE projects don’t use entity beans at all. If you have the freedom, choose frameworks, or parts of frameworks, that are harmonious with the style of design you want to use.</p> <p>The Relationship with FACTORIES
A FACTORY handles the beginning of an object’s life; a REPOSITORY helps manage the middle and the end. When objects are being held in memory, or stored in an object database, this is straightforward. But typically there is at least some object storage in relational databases, files, or other, non-object-oriented systems. In such cases, the retrieved data must be reconstituted into object form.</p> <p>Because the REPOSITORY is, in this case, creating objects based on data, many people consider the REPOSITORY to be a FACTORY—indeed it is, from a technical point of view. But it is more useful to keep the model in the forefront, and as mentioned before, the reconstitution of a stored object is not the creation of a new conceptual object. In this domain-driven view of the design, FACTORIES and REPOSITORIES have distinct responsibilities. The FACTORY makes new objects; the REPOSITORY finds old objects. The client of a REPOSITORY should be given the illusion that the objects are in memory. The object may have to be reconstituted (yes, a new instance may be created), but it is the same conceptual object, still in the middle of its life cycle.</p> <p>These two views can be reconciled by making the REPOSITORY delegate object creation to a FACTORY, which (in theory, though seldom in practice) could also be used to create objects from scratch.</p> <p>Image
Figure 6.22. A REPOSITORY uses a FACTORY to reconstitute a preexisting object.</p> <p>This clear separation also helps by unloading all responsibility for persistence from the FACTORIES. A FACTORY’S job is to instantiate a potentially complex object from data. If the product is a new object, the client will know this and can add it to the REPOSITORY, which will encapsulate the storage of the object in the database.</p> <p>Image
Figure 6.23. A client uses a REPOSITORY to store a new object.</p> <p>One other case that drives people to combine FACTORY and REPOSITORY is the desire for “find or create” functionality, in which a client can describe an object it wants and, if no such object is found, will be given a newly created one. This function should be avoided. It is a minor convenience at best. A lot of cases in which it seems useful go away when ENTITIES and VALUE OBJECTS are distinguished. A client that wants a VALUE OBJECT can go straight to a FACTORY and ask for a new one. Usually, the distinction between a new object and an existing object is important in the domain, and a framework that transparently combines them will actually muddle the situation.</p> <p>DESIGNING OBJECTS FOR RELATIONAL DATABASES
The most common nonobject component of primarily object-oriented software systems is the relational database. This reality presents the usual problems of a mixture of paradigms (see Chapter 5). But the database is more intimately related to the object model than are most other components. The database is not just interacting with the objects; it is storing the persistent form of the data that makes up the objects themselves. A good deal has been written about the technical challenges of mapping objects to relational tables and effectively storing and retrieving them. A recent discussion can be found in Fowler 2003. There are reasonably refined tools for creating and managing mappings between the two. Apart from the technical concerns, this mismatch can have a significant impact on the object model.</p> <p>There are three common cases:</p> <ol><li><p>The database is primarily a repository for the objects.</p></li> <li><p>The database was designed for another system.</p></li> <li><p>The database is designed for this system but serves in roles other than object store.</p></li></ol> <p>When the database schema is being created specifically as a store for the objects, it is worth accepting some model limitations in order to keep the mapping very simple. Without other demands on schema design, the database can be structured to make aggregate integrity safer and more efficient as updates are made. Technically, the relational table design does not have to reflect the domain model. Mapping tools are sophisticated enough to bridge significant differences. The trouble is, multiple overlapping models are just too complicated. Many of the same arguments presented for MODEL-DRIVEN DESIGN—avoiding separate analysis and design models—apply to this mismatch. This does entail some sacrifice in the richness of the object model, and sometimes compromises have to be made in the database design (such as selective denormalization), but to do otherwise is to risk losing the tight coupling of model and implementation. This approach doesn’t require a simplistic one-object/one-table mapping. Depending on the power of the mapping tool, some aggregation or composition of objects may be possible. But it is crucial that the mappings be transparent, easily understandable by inspecting the code or reading entries in the mapping tool.</p> <p>• When the database is being viewed as an object store, don’t let the data model and the object model diverge far, regardless of the powers of the mapping tools. Sacrifice some richness of object relationships to keep close to the relational model. Compromise some formal relational standards, such as normalization, if it helps simplify the object mapping.</p> <p>• Processes outside the object system should not access such an object store. They could violate the invariants enforced by the objects. Also, their access will lock in the data model so that it is hard to change when the objects are refactored.</p> <p>On the other hand, there are many cases in which the data comes from a legacy or external system that was never intended as a store of objects. In this situation, there are, in reality, two domain models coexisting in the same system. Chapter 14, “Maintaining Model Integrity,” deals with this issue in depth. It may make sense to conform to the model implicit in the other system, or it may be better to make the model completely distinct.</p> <p>Another reason for exceptions is performance. Quirky design changes may have to be introduced to solve execution speed problems.</p> <p>But for the important common case of a relational database acting as the persistent form of an object-oriented domain, simple directness is best. A table row should contain an object, perhaps along with subsidiaries in an AGGREGATE. A foreign key in the table should translate to a reference to another ENTITY object. The necessity of sometimes deviating from this simple directness should not lead to total abandonment of the principle of simple mappings.</p> <p>The UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE can help tie the object and relational components together to a single model. The names and associations of elements in the objects should correspond meticulously to those of the relational tables. Although the power of some mapping tools may make this seem unnecessary, subtle differences in relationships will cause a lot of confusion.</p> <p>The tradition of refactoring that has increasingly taken hold in the object world has not really affected relational database design much. What’s more, serious data migration issues discourage frequent change. This may create a drag on the refactoring of the object model, but if the object model and the database model start to diverge, transparency can be lost quickly.</p> <p>Finally, there are some reasons to go with a schema that is quite distinct from the object model, even when the database is being created specifically for your system. The database may also be used by other software that will not instantiate objects. The database may require little change, even while the behavior of the objects changes or evolves rapidly. Cutting the two loose from each other is a seductive path. It is often taken unintentionally, when the team fails to keep the database current with the model. If the separation is chosen consciously, it can result in a clean database schema—not an awkward one full of compromises conforming to last year’s object model.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><div class="edit-link"><a href="https://github.com/impapai/Domain-Driven-Design-zh/edit/master/docs/ch6.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">帮助我们改善此页面！</a> <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></div> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated:</span> <span class="time">12/29/2019, 2:09:47 PM</span></div></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
